                The dataset focuses on summarizing network traffic data across 10 workstations whose IP’s have been coded as 0-9, across a three-month period, from 2006-07-01 to 2006-09-30. It contains 21K rows, with 4 columns: Date, L-ipn (the local IP address), r_asn (The remote asn), f:flows (count of connections for that day) The purpose was to track odd activity on each IP to determine whether the IP was compromised.

            <p>For the machine learning component of this project, a Linear Regression model was implemented to analyse the relationship between local IP numbers and network traffic flows.</p> 

            <p>Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict a numerical value by fitting a straight line to observed data. In this case:</p> 
            <ul>
                <li>The independent variable (X) is the local IP number (l_ipn) </li>
                <li>The dependent variable (Y) is the number of network flows (f) </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The dataset was loaded using the Pandas library in Python. The model was implemented using the LinearRegression class from the Scikit-learn library. The model was trained using the .fit() method, which determines the best-fitting line using the least squares approach. </p>
<br>
<h2>Implementation</h2>     
<p>The core part of the implementation is shown below:</p> 
<code>
    X = df[["l_ipn"]] 
    y = df["f"] 
 
    model = LinearRegression() 
    model.fit(X, y) 
</code>

<p>After training the model, predictions were generated and visualised using Matplotlib. </p>

<h2>Results:</h2>
<p>The regression model produced the following equation: </p>
<p>Flows = -3.13 × l_ipn + 107.16 </p>
<p>Figure shows the regression line plotted against the actual dataset values. </p>
<img src="Img/Figure1.png" alt="Figure 1">
<p class="bolder">Figure : Linear Regression showing the relationship between Local IP Number and Network Flows </p>
<h2>Interpretation of Results </h2>
<p>From Figure 1, it is clear that most IP addresses generate very low numbers of flows, as seen by the cluster of
    points near zero on the graph. </p>
<p>However, two IP addresses generate extremely high traffic values (reaching several hundred thousand connections in a
    single day). These values act as strong outliers in the dataset. </p>
<p>Due to the presence of these extreme values, the regression line appears nearly flat. This indicates that there is no
    strong linear relationship between the IP number and the number of flows across the dataset as a whole. Instead, the
    data is heavily influenced by a small number of unusually large traffic values. </p>
<p>The slope of the regression equation (-3.13) is relatively small compared to the scale of the outliers, further
    supporting the conclusion that IP number alone does not strongly predict network flow volume. </p>
<h2>Relevance to Cybersecurity </h2>
<p>In a cybersecurity context, extreme deviations from normal traffic patterns may indicate unusual or suspicious
    activity. The very large flow values observed for certain IP addresses could represent abnormal network behaviour,
    potential system misconfiguration, or possible malicious activity. </p>
<p>Although linear regression helps visualise overall trends, it does not fully capture irregular spikes in network
    traffic. More advanced models or anomaly detection techniques may be required for deeper analysis </p>

            <h1 class="display-1">Conclusion</h1>
            <p>This project analayzes network traffic data collected from 10 workstations (coded 0-9) over a three month period - July 1st -September 30th 2006.</p>
            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The primary goal of this project was to detect unusual or suspicious activity patterns across machines and determine whether any workstation may have been compromised.</p>
            <h2>Dataset Cleaning and Preparation</h2>
            <p>Before analysis, the dataset was prepared by:</p>
            <p>- Removing formatting inconsistencies in column names</p>
            <p>- Verifying date formatting and chronological ordering</p>
            <p>- Checking for missing or zero value anomalies</p>
            <p>- Ensuring numeric consistency in flow counts</p>
            <p>This ensured reliable statistical analysis and machine learning modeling</p>
            <h2>Visual Analysis</h2>
            <p>Across the full 3 month period:</p>
            <p>- Most IP addresses recieved relatively equal traffic volumes</p>
            <p>- IP '4' showed significantly higher total connections</p>
            <p>- This deviation strongly suggests abnormal behaviour</p>
            <h2>Machine Learning Analysis</h2>
            <p>A linear Regression model was implemented to evaluate whether IP number predicts traffic volume: <br>Flows = -3.13 × l_ipn + 107.16 </p>
            <p>- Most IPs generate low traffic volumes, except a few extreme outliers</p>
            <p>- The slope is small, showing that IP number alone does not predict traffic volume</p>
            <p>- Outliers like IP ‘4’ dominate the dataset, highlighting anomalous behavior</p>
            <h2>Cybersecurity Implications</h2>
            <p>High traffic spikes may indicate botnets or automated attacks, while periods of zero traffic may signal shutdown</p>
            <p>Behavioral deviations are often more critical than overall traffic averages</p>
            <p>Visual analytics combined with machine learning enhances detection of unusual network activity</p>
            <h2>Limitations and Future Work</h2>
            <p>Linear regression is sensitive to extreme values and IP number is not a strong predictor of flow volumes</p>
            <p>Future improvements could include:</p>
            <p>   - Time series anomaly detection</p>
            <p>   - Clustering or Isolation Forest models</p>
            <p>   - Classification models to flag potentially compromised machines</p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This analysis successfully identified network anomalies and highlighted the importance of monitoring traffic deviations</p>
            <p>The most notable finding was the extreme spike on IP 4, suggesting botnet participation, while other IPs showed shutdown periods a practical approach to detecting unusual or suspicious network activity in cybersecurity contexts</p>
