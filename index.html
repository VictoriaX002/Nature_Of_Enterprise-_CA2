            <p>
                The dataset focuses on summarizing network traffic data across 10 workstations whose IP’s have been coded as 0-9, across a three-month period, from 2006-07-01 to 2006-09-30. It contains 21K rows, with 4 columns: Date, L-ipn (the local IP address), r_asn (The remote asn), f:flows (count of connections for that day) The purpose was to track odd activity on each IP to determine whether the IP was compromised.

            <div class="spacing">
                <p>The graph below shows the total connections to each IP across the entire period. This graph shows that each IP had a near equal number of connections, with the exception of IP ‘4’ which had way more connections than the rest, potentially showing that it has been turned into part of a botnet. </p>
                <canvas id="main-chart"></canvas>
                <p>The graph below shows the daily connections to IP ‘0’ across the whole period. The highest spike was around 2006-08-19, however the number of connections stabilized afterwards. </p>
                <canvas id="myChart-0"></canvas>
                <p>The graph below shows the daily connections to IP ‘1’ across the whole period. The amount of connections stays mostly stable, however at around 2006-08-26, the IP suddenly started getting 0 connections per day, possibly meaning that it was shut down. </p>
                <canvas id="myChart-1"></canvas>
                <p>The graph below shows the daily connections to IP ‘2’ across the whole period. The highest spike was around 2006-09-23, however the number of connections stabilized afterwards. </p>
                <canvas id="myChart-2"></canvas>
                <p>The graph below shows the daily connections to IP ‘3’ across the whole period. The graph had multiple high spikes, being at around 2006-07-15, 2006-08-19 and 2006-09-30. After the last spike, the IP started getting 0 connections daily, showing that it may have been shut down. </p>
                <canvas id="myChart-3"></canvas>
                <p>The graph below shows the daily connections to IP ‘4’ across the whole period. This graph shows that the connections were stable until around 2006-09-16, when a huge spike of hundreds of thousands of connections happen in one day, showing that the IP had become part of a botnet. </p>
                <canvas id="myChart-4"></canvas>
                <p>The graph below shows the daily connections to IP ‘5’ across the whole period. The highest spike was around 2006-07-22, after which it stabilized until 2006-09-09, when the connections to the IP daily became 0, showing it was possibly shut down. </p>
                <canvas id="myChart-5"></canvas>
                <p>The graph below shows the daily connections to IP ‘6’ across the whole period. This graph shows multiple high spikes at 2006-07-15, 2006-08-19 and 2006-09-23. </p>
                <canvas id="myChart-6"></canvas>
                <p>The graph below shows the daily connections to IP ‘7’ across the whole period. The graph had big fluctuations in the amount of daily connections. </p>
                <canvas id="myChart-7"></canvas>
                <p>The graph below shows the daily connections to IP ‘8’ across the whole period. The graph had multiple high spikes at 2006-07-08, 2006-09-23 and 2006-09-30 </p>
                <canvas id="myChart-8"></canvas>
                <p>The graph below shows the daily connections to IP ‘8’ across the whole period. The graph had big fluctuations in the number of daily connections. There was also a period from 2006-09-02 to 2006-09-16 where the machine seemed shut down. </p>
